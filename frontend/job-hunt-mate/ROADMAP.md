## Architecture Decisions Records

### ADR 1: Standalone Components
- **Decision**: Use Angular's standalone components
- **Context**: Reduced bundle size, better tree-shaking
- **Status**: Implemented

### ADR 2: Security Implementation
- **Decision**: Custom interceptors for security headers
- **Context**: Enhanced security with minimal overhead
- **Status**: Implemented

### ADR 3: State Management
- **Decision**: Service-based state management
- **Context**: Application size doesn't warrant NgRx
- **Status**: Implemented

### ADR 4: Premium Features
- **Decision**: Feature flags through FeatureAccess service
- **Context**: Allows granular control of premium features
- **Status**: Implemented

## Notes for Developers
- Follow Angular style guide
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement error handling in services
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use proper Git commit messages
- Update unit tests for new features
